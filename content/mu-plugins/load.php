# http://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins
# WordPress only looks for PHP files right inside the mu-plugins directory, 
# and (unlike for normal plugins) not for files in subdirectories.
# Thus we need to load these manually

# Uncomment to use root relative urls
#require WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR.'/root-relative-urls/sb_root_relative_urls.php';
